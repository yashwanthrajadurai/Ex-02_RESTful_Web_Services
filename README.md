# Ex-02_RESTful_Web_Services
## Aim:

To create, deploy and execute RESTful Web service programs using Server, Client and Client-Side remote invocation
## Procedure:

### Server side:
**Step 1**: Create a new Java Web Project. Follow Steps 1-5 as in SOAP Based Web Service.

**Step 2**: Right-click on the project name and select New->RESTful Web Services from Patterns.

**Step 4**: In the next window, give a Resource Package name and choose MIME Type as “text/html”. Click Finish.

**Step 5**: Two editing tabs will appear. Close “ApplicationConfig.java”. You need to write all your required functionalities in GenericResource.java.

**Step 6**: Alter getHtml() method as shown below.

**Step 7**: Save your project, clean and build it. Deploy your project.

**Step 8**: To test your web service, open a new browser window/tab and type the URL as http://localhost:8080/project_name/webresources/generic?params=45&params=35 and hit enter. (This is the easiest way of testing the web service when it makes use of List).



### Client-Side:


**Step 1**: Create a new Java Web Project. Follow steps 1-5 as in section 1.1.

**Step 2**: Right-click on the project and select New->RESTful Java Client.

**Step 3**: A new window will appear. In that, give a name to your client, a package name and select “From Project” under the “Select the REST resource:” tab and click Browse. 

**Step 4**: Carefully select your RESTful resource (web service) and click OK.

**Step 7**: Right-click on the Libraries folder under your project and select “Add JAR/Folder”.

**Step 8**: A new window will appear. Navigate to the folder where you have placed the “javax.ws.rs-api2.0.1.jar” file and select Open.

**Step 9**: Right-click on the Web Pages folder and select JSP. In the new window, give a name to the JSP page and click Finish.

**Step 10**: A new tab will appear with the default contents of the JSP page. In that, include at the top and type the following code to invoke the client java code.

**Step 11**: Save the project and build it.

**Step 12**: Run the JSP file and you should see the output in a new browser window.

### Client-Side Remote Invocation:

**Step 1**: Follow steps 1-5 as in Section 2.2

**Step 2**: In the generated NewJerseyClient.java file, Replace BASE_URI from private static final String BASE_URI = "http://localhost:8080/RESTful_Server/webresources"; TO private static final String BASE_URI = "http://192.168.116.62:8080/RESTful_Server/webresources";

**Step 3**: Follow steps 6-12 as in Section 2.2


## Result:
 Thus, the RESTful web service program has been successfully created and executed.
